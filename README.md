### Hey! I'm [@kameleon](https://twitter.com/tiangolo) (Alvin Delos) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Philippines.

I currently live in Poland.

I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems, in US and Europe, with different teams and organizations. ðŸŒŽ

I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–

If my open source projects are useful for your **product/company** you can also sponsor my work on them. â˜•
